# Learning Intuitive Physics From An Interactive Environment With Vision Language Models

## Installation

We rely on [GAD-cell's `vlm-grpo`](https://github.com/GAD-cell/vlm-grpo) patch of the `unsloth` library.

You can install the package and the requirements directly from the `vlm-grpo` repository:
with pip
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/GAD-cell/vlm-grpo.git@main
```
